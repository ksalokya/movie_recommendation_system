## What is Recommendation System?

#### A Recommender system, or a recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the “rating” or “preference” a user would give to an item.

## Types of Recommendation system

- Content-Based Recommendation Systems - Content-based filtering approaches uses a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.
- Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems - Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from the user’s past behavior (i.e. items purchased or searched by the user) as well as similar decisions made by other users.

##### There are two categories of CF:

- User-based: measure the similarity between target users and other users.
- Item-based: measure the similarity between the items that target users rates/ interacts with and other items.


##### This project is based on Content-Based Recommendation Systems and dataset used is [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/).
